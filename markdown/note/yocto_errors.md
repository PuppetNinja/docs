# sssssssssssss

 <fredcadete> you could add your own .bb file in your layer, and then use some mechanism like PREFERRED_VERSION_u-boot or PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader to force your version

<redengin> the machconfig inside the bsp layer is usually how you control uboot configuration

<gGary Thomas> Try looking at some of the <MACHINE>.conf files in meta-fsl-arm
where you should be able to see how to set up the U-Boot build.
